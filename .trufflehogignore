# .trufflehogignore — Paths and patterns that are known false positives for TruffleHog
#
# Trade-off documentation:
# TruffleHog without --only-verified catches more secrets (including unverified/high-entropy
# strings) but generates false positives on config files, docs, and test fixtures.
# This file mitigates false positives. Gitleaks with custom pattern rules provides the
# authoritative verdict; TruffleHog is defense-in-depth.
#
# Format: glob patterns, one per line
# Syntax: https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog#gitignore-syntax
